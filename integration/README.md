# Integration Tests

This directory contains useful scripts for running and testing SkyBin locally. 

To get started, run `setup.sh &`. This will setup SkyBin in a `repo` subfolder within 
this directory and start metadata, provider, and renter services. 

Run `teardown.sh` to stop the services and delete the SkyBin setup.
